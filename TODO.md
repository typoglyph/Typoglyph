# TODO List
* Touchscreen support
  * Text is selectable while dragging an option
  * Dragging causes options to disappear from options bar until dropped
  * Dragging an option from a gap duplicates it instead of moves it (should we just not allow dragging options from gaps? This makes the reset button the only way to fix a mistake)
  * Error in console: *TypeError: prefixedPropREs[vendor].test is not a function*
  * Switch to minified version of interact library
* Graphical overhaul
* Show which puzzles you got wrong on the results page
